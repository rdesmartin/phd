# Presentation Draft

## Story

How much detail do we give in the introduction?

Here is what NN verification problems currently are: we want to verify NN properties, there are multiple properties, functional languages are used to do these NN verification tasks.

As NN computation involves a lot of matrix operations, the choice of matrix representation is important. To illustrate the importance of matrix choice, let's look at the work we're currently undertaking with Imandra.

Here is Imandra, here is what it does and how it compares to other verification tools (ML language, etc)

Here are the possible matrix representation
