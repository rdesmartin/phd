	abstract = {This paper investigates several sparse matrix representation schemes and associated algorithms in Haskell for solving linear systems of equations arising from solving realistic computational fluid dynamics problems using a finite element algorithm. This work complements that of Wainwright and Sexton (1992) in that a Choleski direct solver (with an emphasis on its forward/backward substitution steps) is examined. Experimental evidence comparing time and space efficiency of these matrix representation schemes is reported, together with associated forward/backward substitution implementations. Our results are in general agreement with Wainwright and Sexton's.},
